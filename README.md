This is the Dart implementation of [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev), a vendor-agnostic abstraction library for evaluating feature flags.

We support multiple data types for flags (numbers, strings, booleans, objects) as well as hooks, which can alter the lifecycle of a flag evaluation.

## Installation

```yml
dependencies:
  openfeature: ^0.0.2
```

### Initialization

```dart
import 'package:openfeature/openfeature.dart';

final api = OpenFeatureAPI();
// set your own provider
api.provider = EnvVarProvider();
final client = api.getClient('myClient');
final result = await client.getBooleanValue('myBoolFlag', false);
```
